# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. We were assigned a big project, to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. After the successful completion of that project we are assigned another project with Omar. To create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Overview of the analysis
**Resources used**

For this project two CSV files were used that had ride data and city data. 
- **Ride Data file:** The ride data CSV file includes 2376 rows and 4 columns, namely:- City, Date, Fare, ride_id. The first 10 rows of this csv file is as follows:

[city_data](/Resources/city_data.csv)

**Technology used** 
Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.

**Coding language used** 
Python was the main coding language, we used SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python functions.
